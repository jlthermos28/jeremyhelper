# jeremyhelper

This is an IN PROGRESS project I am building for the IT team at Marist College (Where I currently work). The name "jeremyhelper" is an inside joke and will be updated when the official 1.0 version releases. 

The main concept for this is a program that will streamline the entire deployment process. It's main function is to automatically create pieces of texts that can be directly copied into our ticketing system, whether it's pre deploy or post deploy. The IT team here at marist is responsible for the testing, deployment, and maintanence of all PCs on campus, and this program is designed to make that process more efficient. By inputting certain fields and checking off certain boxes, customized outputs will be generated, using a basic template, that the employee can then simply paste into the CSR. An added benefit to this is that the updates within the tickets will become more consistent, given that the program uses a template, like stated before.
