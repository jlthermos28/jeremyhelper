Logic: (Was this a new user or replacement?).
	(Laptop or Desktop?) 

New:
The deploy took place in (Building and room number). The new computer is a (Model) with tag (tag).
I had the user sign into the new machine with their domain account and installed the
wired and (laptop: wireless) certs. I had the user log into (list software user logged into). 
(Printers mapped? If yes, list dns with commas) Share drives mapped with paths (paths separated by commas if multiple) 
(Enrolled in pgp?) If yes: I enrolled the user in PGP on the
machine and restarted the machine (if laptop: with the ethernet disconnected) to demonstrate
the process. I also restocked the users (Old device) w/ tag (old tag). The user did not
need any other data off the (old device). I deployed the equipment in Stock Tracking.I lastly placed the CSR, Equipment
Tracking Forms and deployment checklists, into their appropriate bins.





Replacement:
The deploy took place in (Building and room number). The new computer is a (Model) with tag (tag).
Transferred the data of the users bookmarks and data onto (pluto or ssd). (Was onedrive used in the backup process?) 
(Tsm or temp folder?). I had the
user sign into the new machine with their domain account and installed the
wired and wireless certs. I had the user log into (list software user logged into). 
Transferred the bookmarks and data onto the new machine.

updated the replacement spreadsheet. I lastly placed the CSR, Equipment
Tracking Forms and deployment checklists, into their appropriate bins.
